#  Power BI Visualization – Population Data Analysis (2022)

This project showcases a core visualization I built as part of my Data Analytics internship using Power BI.

For this task, I used **Power BI** to design:

-  A **bar chart** visualizing **country-wise population in 2022**
-  A **histogram** showing the **distribution of countries by population range**

##  Key Steps:
- Cleaned and prepared the dataset for clarity  
- Binned population data to form meaningful ranges  
- Customized visuals with titles, axes, and filters  
- Focused on making insights visually accessible and easy to interpret
